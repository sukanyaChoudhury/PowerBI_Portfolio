## Dashboard



## Project Insight
- Women customers are more likely to buy products compared to men (~65%).
- The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 product buyers.
- The adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%) and buys the most products.
- The maximum number of products customer orders from Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels.
- More than 90% of the products delivered

## Final Conclusion:
To improve the sales of Vrinda Store, a strategic marketing plan focused on women aged 30-49 years residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh should be implemented. This demographic represents a key consumer segment, as they often make significant household and lifestyle purchases. The approach should include targeted digital marketing campaigns and personalized promotions to capture their attention.
