## Project Insight
- Orders are highest on Weekends.(FRI, SAT, SUN)
- There are maximum orders from the month of July and January
- Classic Category contributes maximum sales(~27%) and Max Orders (14888)
- Large Size Pizza contributes to  maximum sales (~46%) and X-Large/XX-Large Pizzas have lowest sales.
- Best Seller by Revenue is "The Thai Chicken Pizza" and the Best Seller by Quantity Sold, Total Orders is "The Classic Deluxe Pizza".
- Worst Seller in all three parameters is "The Brie Carre Pizza"

## Final Conclusion:
To improve the Pizza sales, a strategic marketing plan for the weekends sales should be implemented. Customers make maximum purchases on weekends so more lucrative offers can be rolled out to improve sales. X-Large/XX-Large Pizzas as well as The Brie Carre Pizza have lowest sales so feedback must be taken from customers on the products and if sales don't improve further even after rolling offers, reducing price and implementing customer's feedback, they can be discontinued.</br>
